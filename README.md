OpenShift V2 Cartridge to run Apache Httpd
==========================================

This cartridge was created by following the guides (see below in the References) to the new V2 formar for OpenShift cartridges. Nothing really useful except the hands-on learning, and one more way to serve static content on OpenShift (there are so many other ways).

## Features

Runs Apache httpd server in OpenShift gear. And that's about it.

## Warning

* The configuration of the Apache httpd server has not been tuned or tweaked in any way
* If used as-is this cartridge may leave your OpenShift app vulnerable to security threats and expose your files to malicious threats
* Use at your own risk!
